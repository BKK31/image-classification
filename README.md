# Image Classification Project

A Python project that utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to create an image classification system.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow 2.x
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* PIL

## Setup

1. Install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
    pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow
    ```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bkk31/image-classification.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
    cd image-classification
    ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook using Python 3.x:
   ```bash
    jupyter notebook Main.ipynb
    ```

## Notes

* This project uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the image classification model.
* Make sure to check the library documentation for any updates or changes to the API.
* Also, ensure that the dataset is properly configured and loaded.

## Important Note: 
* The EfficientNetB0 model used in this project has been observed to achieve state-of-the-art results on various image classification tasks.
* However, the performance of the model may vary depending on the quality and diversity of the training dataset.
